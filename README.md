# Item Icon Updater
A Foundry VTT Module for updating icons with missing images based on the D&amp;D5e SRD icons.

Updates some icons for actions and other items with missing icons. Searches all items from all actors in the current world for missing icons, and checks a curated list based on the SRD. Update happens automatically on page refresh. Icons for tokens already existing on the map are not updated - a new token must be brought in from the actor. This is particularly useful in conjunction with VTTA D&D Beyond Integration. After importing monsters from D&D Beyond, simply refresh the page to update the icons.
